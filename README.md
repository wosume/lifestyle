## Office employees do not always get more

Working at home is not only about reduced stress, a convenient schedule and a test of discipline. Although it is believed that working in an office brings more money, it is not always the case - the knowledge and skills of an employee are often more important than where he is. We have gathered seven professions that allow you to work from home and earn solid money.

## Manager or director
for business development
 
In times of crisis, it is more important than ever for businesses to look for new growth directions. The analyst, who will do it, does not need to sit in the office at all. Working remotely, it is easier to look at the work from the outside, to search for weaknesses, to monitor how his proposals are implemented, and to establish relationships with other companies. The spread of salaries among managers and directors of business development is large and highly depends on experience, but a proven specialist can claim to be high even by Moscow standards of earnings and convenient schedule.
 
## Sales Manager
  
More and more companies do not mind to keep their sales managers remotely. The main thing is that a person finds customers, and he can contact them from home. Earnings depend entirely on the quantity and quality of contracts concluded: the manager receives interest from them. The most talented people can expect to earn a salary comparable to that of their colleagues who come to the office every day.
 
## Programmer

The demand for programmers does not fall, and there are not enough good programmers at all. That's why many employers are ready to make sure that the employee stays at home if he is constantly in touch and disciplined to perform tasks. The spread in programming languages and development environments is not so great: if you know something more or less in demand, whether it's JavaScript, C# or Ruby, you're almost certainly going to find a suitable job with a high salary.

## Translator
 
Of course, not every translator can count on a high salary. Several factors must come together: extensive work experience, positive references, not too standard foreign language and a generous employer who needs this language at all costs. At the same time, translation is an ideal job for home, which allows you to change the daily routine to suit your needs.
 
## System Administrator
 
A specialist who monitors the stable operation of servers does not need to sit next to them - almost all problems can be solved remotely. Another thing is that this is a stressful job, which requires to be alert 24 hours a day, and it is clearly not suitable for everyone. Those who are willing to take a risk will have a solid salary, which will not be inferior to that of the system administrators in the office.
